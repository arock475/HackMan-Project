# HackMan-Project
Hackman is a coding project modeled on the Clemson CPSC Hackman competition

Hackman is based on the childhood game of hangman 

Hangman is the game where there is a word to guess and the player guesses letters until they run out of guesses or they successfully guess the word

My rendition of hangman currently uses a list of words and randomly selects one from there

In the future I plan to create my own API in order to randomly output a word to the game
