# HackMan-Project
A coding project modeled on the Clemson CPSC Hackman competition

In this project I am building a hangman game which in the future will use a custom API to get the word that is being guessed

Currently a list of words is used which will be randomly selected from

Then you play hangman using the same rules as are used in the childhood game of hangman
