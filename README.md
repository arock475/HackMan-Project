# HackMan-Project
Hackman is a coding project modeled on the Clemson CPSC Hackman competition.
Due to other commitments I was not able to take part in the actual competition but I planned to come back to the idea later as a method of practice.

This competition was to make a hangman game with a GUI

I used this project as a method of practice and learning.
In this project I began using Python again for the first time in years and I learned how to use the TKinter library in order to make a GUI

This project has now been updated to get the word from a custom API that I created
The API is being run from pythonanywhere and returns a random word for each game of hackman
