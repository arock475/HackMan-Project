# HackMan-Project
## What This Is

### Hackman was a coding competition proposed the Clemson Computer Science Discord as a means of getting people to learn new things
  * Due to other commitments I was not able to take part in the actual competition but I planned to come back to the idea later as a method of practice.
### Project Structure
  * There are two main python files, one that creates and uses a GUI and one that is command line based
  * There is also a copy of my original code to choose a random word which has been replaced by a custom API hosted on pythonanywhere

## Why I Did it
### I used this project as a method of practice and learning.
  *In this project I began using Python again for the first time in several years and I learned how to use the TKinter library in order to make a GUI
